Bluegrid is a mobile app aimed at empowering citizens to combat pollution along coastlines and protect marine ecosystems. 

With a few taps on their phone, citizens can document pollution incidents they encounter by capturing images and marking GPS locations, creating comprehensive reports that are sent to the nearest waste manager via app notifications, SMS and email. This streamlined reporting process ensures prompt handling and resolving of waste-related issues such as marine plastics, bin overflows, illegal dumping, sewage outflows, chemical leaks, and oil spills. 

The app's underlying technology utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyse the data collected from pollution incident reports. This analysis focuses on identifying and tracking materials to better understand waste distribution and develop effective strategies to combat pollution's impact on marine life and coastal environments.
